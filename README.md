Active learning: creating a figure

In this active learning section, we'd like you to take the finished code from embeding an image active learning section, and turn it into a figure:

Wrap it in a &lt;figure&gt; element.

Copy the text out of the title attribute, remove the title attribute, and put the text inside a &lt;figcaption&gt; element below the image.
